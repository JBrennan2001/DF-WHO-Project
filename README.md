# DF-WHO-Project
In the WHO group project, we used linear regression modelling to predict average life expectancies of countries and presented our models to the client.

## Project Description
We were tasked with creating a function that estimates the life expectancy of a country given certain statistics about that country. To help us with this, we were provided with a dataset from WHO (World Health Organisation) that contained the actual life expectancy of 183 countries between 2000-2015.
