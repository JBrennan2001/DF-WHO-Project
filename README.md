# DF-WHO-Project
In the WHO group project, we used linear regression modelling to predict average life expectancies of countries and presented our models to the client.

## Project Description
We were tasked with creating a function that estimates the life expectancy of a country given certain statistics about that country. To help us with this, we were provided with a dataset from WHO (World Health Organisation) that contained the actual life expectancy of 183 countries between 2000-2015 as well as other population statistics about these countries. Using the Python libraries including Pandas and Sklearn, we created linear regression models to achieve the best possible predictions. We created two separate models:
* one <b> advanced model </b> which used all the features from the dataset necessary to create the best possible prediction for life expectancy,
* one <b> ethical model </b> which takes into account ethical considerations and omits certain sensitive data from the advanced model.

We then created function which takes in relevant population statistics used in the model and returns a predicted life expectancy. A choice is given on which of the two models to use.

At the end of the project, we presented our work to the rest of the Digital Futures cohort.
